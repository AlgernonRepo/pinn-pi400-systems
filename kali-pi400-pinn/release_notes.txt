Method I used to add manjaro(kali64) to pinn os pi400

I built kali with ext4 by mistake so after install atm you must change ext3 to ext4 in recovery.commandline
I also replaced config.txt directly from fresh sdcard not sure  if this was needed
instead of BOOT_MNJRO and ROOT_MNJRO i used Kali64boot and Kali64root

1. Download manjaro-xx-xxx-xx.img.xz and renamed to manajro64.
2. Using ubuntu 20.04 lts installed all dependencies I could for both pinnify and pinn, installed also build-essentials and libarchivetools (terminal recommended) 
3. git cloned pinnify then before installing created manjaro64 template by copying first the template gentoo64 and changing as in the pinn os docs. Use MNJRO_BOOT and MNJRO_ROOT as partition names and names of resulting tar.xz . Removed checksum lines from two .json and trailing comma
4. Install pinnify
5. Check to see if manjaro template is installed with list-templates
7. Make directories as seen in instructions then add manjaro64.img.xz to /root/
8. enter the main command where 21.10 is version and 4.19.67-1 is kernel. these do not appear to need to be exact
9. enter the following command

root@al-HP-Notebook:~# pinnify create-release manjaro64 21.10 4.19.67-1 /root/releases/ /root/manjaro64.img.xz
* PINN image creator v0.0.1
* Creating working directory '/var/lib/pinnify'
* Temporarily decompressing image (may take some time)
* Mounted /root/manjaro64.img.xz on /dev/loop8
* 2 partitions located in /dev/loop8, continuing
* Creating temporary mountpoint
* Analysing partition 'BOOT_MNJRO'
* Finding size of partition 'BOOT_MNJRO' in KiB, MiB
* Tarring up partition 'BOOT_MNJRO'
* Compressing tarball (may take some time)
* Analysing partition 'ROOT_MNJRO'
* Finding size of partition 'ROOT_MNJRO' in KiB, MiB
* Tarring up partition 'ROOT_MNJRO'
* Compressing tarball (may take some time)
* Unmounting /dev/loop8
* Moving tarballs into /root/releases/manjaro64-21.10
* Copying template files into /root/releases/manjaro64-21.10
* (and updating with release metadata)
* Preparing / updating slides_vga using script
Can't update slide: please ensure convert and exiftool are installed
* 
* All done!

10. confirms slides are as they should be as they were fow me despite the warning and renamed the final folder to remove the version number back to manjaro64.
11. installed by adding an /os/manjaro64 folder with all the files on a usb stick then it appeared for main the pinn os sd card to install.
12. using grsync added the over 1gb file to sourceforge then added rest of files
