test folder originally an attempt to partition 512gb sd card with around 
30gb each for batoceradev64 retropie64 lakka64 libreelec lineage19
45gb each manjaro64 kali64 ubuntu64
7gb openwrt
200gb of freespace to be used to store games and movies

use alternate repo lists to change icons or have all entries in one main list
added 34px and 40px matching set of icons to all os supported by pin.
the default size of icons is 40px but I found I liked the 34px size so that all all 9 os on my sdcard will be visibile on boot menu at once. 
icons best used with no_default_source specified in recovery.cmdline
